# Bot Bilby v4
A recode of bot bilby so it doesn't crash every 5 seconds.

## Notices
This project was designed with The Heeler House as it's main target, so many of the functionality (Text Commands & Events) **have been tailored** specifically to THH. While you can change the config (in `testingIds.json`) to make the bot work for your own server, it is recommended that you install and use the bot only for development and testing purposes.

## Setting Up
### **Dependencies**
To install and run the bot, make sure that you have the following things set up/installed:
- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en)
- A Discord Bot (instruction for how to setup one can be found at [MAKE_A_BOT_BILBY.md](MAKE_A_BOT_BILBY.md))
- The server, with the following required channels
### **Install**
1. Clone the repo into your favorite directory (or if you don't have git, you can [download the repo as a ZIP instead](https://github.com/The-Heeler-House/bot-bilby/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Heeler-House/bot-bilby
```
2. Change directory into the `bot-bilby` folder, and install the required package using npm:
```bash
npm i
```
3. Create a new file in the root of the directory called `.env` (**note the dot at the start of the file**). This will be where you'll store your secret data.
4. Inside the `.env` file, fill in the following information (replace the dot between the quotation mark with actual value):
```env
TOKEN="..." # the bot token
DEVELOPMENT_GUILD="..." # guild to register guild commands in. if this is omitted, global commands will be registered instead.
PREFIX="..." # text command prefix, can be any length.
MONGO_URL="" # connection URL for MongoDB database (should be in the form of: "mongodb://...")
API_PORT=8080 # port that the BilbyAPI service will listen on. used for non-bilby related projects where data from bilby is needed.
```
5. Fill out `testingIds.json` with your appropriate channel and role ids.

### **Run the bot**
Once everything have seen set up, compile and run the bot using:
```
npm run bot-unix # for people using MacOS/Linux
```
or
```
npm run bot-windows # for people using Windows
```
